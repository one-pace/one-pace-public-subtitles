Notably, Viz also uses this exact term in English.}{Rin - He's calling him a "Miyoo" which, from my research, is not dissimilar to the Nio that Gear 4th is based on so it makes sense he also looks like them. The literal translation of their name would be "Brightness Kings" but it seems Wikipedia has the English name for them as "Wisdom Kings" while Encyclopedia Britanica leaves it untranslated as Myō-ō for the title of the article with "Kings of Knowledge" as how they translate it in the body of the article.}
